# News App
An Android Application built in Android Studio using REST API and RETROFIT that displays news under different categories.

ABOUT THE PROJECT:

This app uses NEWSAPI to get various sources and each source can provide major headlines. It
uses RETROFIT 2 to fetch news sources and news headlines from the API and displays in a RecyclerView.
It uses libray to provide offline functionality App first loads the data from DB and then checks for fresh
data from API, API is only called if DB data is empty or expired The main aim of this sample app is show
how to use the architecture guidelines with Kotlin.
News API is a simple JSON-based REST API for searching and retrieving news articles from all over the
web. Using this, one can fetch the top stories running on a news website or can search top news on a
specific topic (or keyword).
News can be retrieved based on some criteria. Say the topic (keyword) to be searched is ‘Science’ or
might be concerned to a specific channel. All can be done, but the API key is needed to get started.
